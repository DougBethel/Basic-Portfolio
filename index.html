  <strong><h2>About Me<h2></strong>
    <img src="C:\Users\dougb\Basic-Portfolio\images\profilepic.jpg"
      <p> So a little about me, I am a technology enthusiast who has spent the
      early part of my career working in telecom and helping enterprises
      navigating the world of packet transport. However, while doing this I
      developed an interest in the content traversing the network and thought
      it would really be cool to learn how to develop my own content and create
       my own web based applications.</p>
      <p> It has been a fun and challenging journey so far, my portfolio will
         put on all the skills I have learned thus far, and what I am willing
         to do to make quality programs and collaborate with teammates.
         Let me know if you would like me to work with or take a look at you
         current web development projects.</p>
