              <img class="profilepic" src="images/profilepic.jpg" width="175">
              <p class="paragraph1">So a little about me, I am a technology enthusiast that has spent my early career in technology sales, and while it has been fun, challenging, and rewarding, it has definitely sparked an interest in learning how to build and host my own website and applications.</p>
              <br><br>
              <p class="paragrapgh2">I think with the tremendous growth we see in how almost every service we consume in our daily lives comes back to web based applications it is a phenomenal space to get into. In addition, there is a major fun of ever changing environment, with a huge appeal for those who love to continue learning and mastering new skillsets.</p>
              <p>I hope as you look at my portfolio you will see not just the skills I have picked up but the passion for coding I have developed and look forward to learning even more and growing a lot more as a developer. If you have any questions about anything you see here feel free to reach out to me via the contact page.</p>
